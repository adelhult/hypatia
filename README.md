# Hypatia
This project is exploration into building an ergonomic domain specific language
for arithmetic calculations - well suited for both simple math and larger homework problems. 
Physical quantities and unit conversions is a central part of the language. Another main 
focus is the ability to evaluate your expressions into LaTeX text strings. The language will most 
likely be interacted with using an WASM based notebook environment.

## Features
* Quantities
* Hex and binary literals
* String interpolation
* LaTeX representation

## Ideas for syntax and semantics
```
// Unsure of the syntax for comments
// would be nice to support markdown formatting
// so it might we wise to avoid using `#` for comments.

// SI-units will of course be included in the prelude
// but they should be easy to define yourself
unit meter
unit Ã…ngstrÃ¶m = 10^(-10) meter

x = 20 km
y = 30 m
z = x + y

binary_literal = 0b10101
hex_literal = 0x32ab KiB

// Some examples of functions
f(x) = 10 + x

is_long_distance(distance) = distance > 20 km

min(a, b) = {
  if a < b {
    a
  } else {
    b
  }
}

// Curly braces can be used to create a block with its own scope
area = {
  length = 20m
  height = 30m
  // the last expression of a block will also be the value of the block expression itself
  length * height 
}

// Declarations are also expressions
foo = bar = 20

// Will most likely have some kind of postfix function application
print(20)
20 @ print

// All blocks (even in if expressions will introduce their own scope)
example = 20
if cond {
  example = 30
}
// that won't change the value of "example"
// instead use the assigment operator "set"
example = 20
if cond {
  set example = 30
}

// or more idiomatically use the if expression itself
example = if cond {
  30
} else {
  20
}
```

## Comparison to other tools/languages
There are a lot of other great languages and tools with a similar purpose,
but I still think there is room for Hypatia to offer another set of features and trade-offs.
